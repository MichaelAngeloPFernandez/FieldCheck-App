CHAPTER 1: THE PROBLEM AND ITS BACKGROUND
================================================================================

Introduction
	Field-based work environments such as maintenance services, logistics, deliveries, construction, inspections, and utility operations require accurate and reliable attendance verification. Traditional manual timekeeping methods, such as paper logs or unverified mobile check-ins, are prone to fraud, human error, and inefficiency.
In recent years, digital attendance systems have emerged to address these issues, although many depend on paid third-party APIs, cloud hosting, or commercial subscriptions, creating cost and privacy concerns for organizations.

FieldCheck is proposed as a self-hosted, mobile-based attendance verification system that uses GPS and geofencing technology to ensure employees can only check in and out when physically present at authorized job sites. By combining a dedicated employee mobile app with an admin dashboard, the system offers location-verified attendance without relying on external cloud services, significantly reducing operational expenses and enhancing data privacy.

Field Area of Project or Study
This study is situated within the fields of:
- GPS and Geofencing Systems – Leveraging location data for operational control
- Workforce Attendance Monitoring Tools – Tools for tracking employee presence
- Location-Based Services – Software applications that use geographic positioning
- Self-Hosted Mobile Systems – Systems deployed on local or private infrastructure rather than public clouds
- Mobile Application Development – Cross-platform development using Flutter framework
- Real-Time Communication Systems – WebSocket-based real-time data synchronization

Problems

General Problem
Organizations with mobile or field-based workers face challenges in accurately verifying attendance and ensuring that employees are present at designated job sites. Manual methods and GPS-based systems that lack geofencing are vulnerable to falsified check-ins.

Specific Problems
1. Fraudulent Attendance Records – Employees may falsify their work location during check-ins
2. Reliance on Paid Third-Party APIs – Many solutions require subscriptions or API fees that increase operational costs
3. Data Privacy Risks – Cloud-hosted systems may expose sensitive location and employee data to third-party providers
4. Limited Offline Functionality – Existing solutions often fail in low connectivity areas, affecting data collection
5. Lack of Task Integration – Attendance systems often operate independently from task management, creating workflow fragmentation
6. Inefficient Reporting – Manual report generation and limited export options hinder decision-making

Objectives of the Study

General Objective:
To develop a self-hosted mobile application that provides accurate, real-time, and location-verified attendance tracking using geofencing and GPS for field-based workforce management, while reducing costs by removing reliance on paid third-party APIs and services.

Specific Objectives:
1. To design a geofencing algorithm using Flutter Map (OpenStreetMap) and GPS coordinates that restricts attendance check-ins/outs to verified job locations
2. To develop a "Task Management" module that allows administrators to assign specific tasks to employees within geofenced areas and track their completion status (pending, in_progress, completed)
3. To implement an "Offline Sync" mechanism using local storage that caches attendance logs when internet connectivity is lost and automatically synchronizes with the MongoDB database upon reconnection
4. To create a real-time admin interface within the mobile app using Socket.io that visualizes active employees, incoming reports, and geofence status updates without requiring page reloads
5. To minimize operational costs by utilizing a Node.js/Express backend with MongoDB and OpenStreetMap data, removing dependencies on paid Google Maps APIs
6. To implement comprehensive reporting functionality with PDF and Excel export capabilities for attendance and task data
7. To support both circular and polygon-based geofencing for flexible job site boundary definitions

Scope
The system will consist of a single integrated mobile application:

FieldCheck Mobile App (Flutter): Available for Android and iOS with role-based interfaces:

Employee Interface: Features include secure login (JWT), GPS-based check-in/out, task viewing, offline data caching, and PDF/Excel report generation.

Admin Interface: Allows creation of circular and polygon geofences, employee profile management, task assignment, attendance reporting with export functionality, and real-time monitoring—all accessible from the mobile app.

The backend is built on Node.js and Express, utilizing MongoDB Atlas for the database and Socket.io for real-time event broadcasting. Security features include password hashing (bcryptjs), JWT authentication, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

The project will focus on GPS-based geofencing with optional integration of Bluetooth beacons for enhanced location accuracy in indoor or weak-signal environments. Offline mode will be implemented to allow local data storage and syncing once connectivity is restored.

Limitations
The project encounters constraints beyond the researchers' control, including:
- GPS Accuracy: The system's accuracy is dependent on the mobile device's hardware sensors and environmental conditions (e.g., tall buildings blocking satellite signals)
- Initial Connectivity: While offline mode is supported, an internet connection is required for the initial login and fetching of assigned geofences
- Battery Consumption: Continuous use of GPS services for geofencing may consume device battery faster than standard applications
- Bluetooth Beacon Integration: Optional feature requiring additional hardware investment; not implemented in initial release
- Polygon Geofencing Complexity: Advanced polygon calculations may impact performance on lower-end devices

Significance of the Study
This project will benefit:

Company Management: By providing a fraud-proof method of verifying employee attendance and simplifying payroll processing through comprehensive reporting and export capabilities.

Field Employees: By streamlining the reporting process and providing clear digital records of their work hours and accomplished tasks, with offline functionality ensuring uninterrupted service.

The IT Field: By demonstrating the viability of open-source mapping solutions (Flutter Map/OpenStreetMap) as a cost-effective alternative to paid commercial geolocation APIs.

By hosting the system locally or on a secure private cloud, organizations can ensure full control over their data, reduce recurring costs, and tailor the system to their operational needs.

Definition of Terms

CHAPTER 2: REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE
================================================================================

The evolution of attendance management systems has largely been influenced by the advancements in mobile computing, geolocation technology, and biometric identification. The decades of relying on manual and biometric-based conventional methods for recording employee and student attendance have been sustained by the vulnerabilities of these methods—proxy attendance risk, infrastructure cost, and field environment inefficiencies—strongly propelling the transition towards mobile and geofenced technologies (Ali et al., 2022; Abdalkarim & Sakarya, 2022). Modern systems now utilize smartphones, cloud-based platforms, and geospatial data to provide precise and real-time location and user identity confirmation (Thiagarajan et al., 2025; Kurnia et al., 2025).

Recent studies emphasize the growing application of geolocation-based attendance verification for field and mobile organizations. For example, Kurnia et al. (2025) developed an Android app that verifies the attendance of workers at certain geofenced locations to maintain attendance regulations. Similarly, Shinde et al. (2022) proposed a mobile-driven system with geofencing to improve accuracy in monitoring, while Kundariya et al. (2024) demonstrated the application of location-based attendance logging in real-time situations. These solutions avoid unauthorized check-ins and minimize reliance on hardware-based biometric tools.

The fusion of biometric identification with geofencing has further improved trustworthiness. Mobile attendance software merging GPS with facial recognition not only confirm presence but also validate identity, thereby eliminating proxy attendance (Aigbokhan et al., 2024; Fadillah & Jalil, 2024; Babatunde et al., 2022). Pawar et al. (2024) took this a step further with real-time liveness detection, preventing spoofing threats, while Kumawat (2021) looked at hybrid systems integrating fingerprint and voice recognition with geofenced verification. These multimodal systems highlight the need for layered verification in academic as well as corporate environments.

Apart from biometric pairing, researchers have also explored system architectures that balance flexibility and security. AttendEase, for instance, combines on-premises and web-based attendance tracking with router-based authentication and mobile interfaces for flexibility with hybrid work and learning environments (Barbaso et al., 2025). In a similar vein, Eweoya et al. (2025) implemented a geofence-based university attendance system for large-scale monitoring challenges. These deployments illustrate the scalability of geofenced platforms for learning and business environments.

Another recurring theme throughout the literature is real-time monitoring of the workforce. GeoWorkTrack (Tile et al., 2024) and others (Mane et al., 2024; Tamboli et al., 2024) demonstrate the way GPS-based attendance systems can be extended to end-to-end employee tracking, task allocation, and monitoring of productivity. These works demonstrate that geofencing is not just an attendance system but also a general workforce management strategy. Adding Internet of Things (IoT) elements further strengthens the system, as demonstrated by Fischer et al. (2024), who integrated geolocation and IoT for intelligent university attendance monitoring.

Beyond education and workforce, geofencing techniques have been used in specialized monitoring environments. Agajo et al. (2023) used an online monitoring system for juvenile school-going children to ensure safety and presence monitoring, while Mohammed (2021) created a GPS-based monitoring system for campuses that verifies student check-ins. Such applications depict the versatility of geofencing technology across various domains, from safety-focused monitoring to institutional compliance.

Even with these improvements, there are still problems. Battery performance and connectivity problems have a tendency to restrict the performance of GPS-based systems (Harshada et al., 2023). These were tackled by Rexline and Nazrin (2024) by suggesting a geotagging attendance model based on Google Maps API to minimize resource utilization. In the same vein, Fatkharrofiqi et al. (2020) pointed out the advantages of light-weight location-based service (LBS) approaches on Android to minimize system overhead. These works emphasize the trade-offs among accuracy, efficiency, and usability in system design.

The systematic reviews of the literature provide an overall picture of the recent trends. Ali et al. (2022) reviewed automated attendance solutions and concluded geolocation, biometrics, and cloud integration as leading trends. Abdalkarim and Sakarya (2022) have also verified the reality that intelligent attendance technologies are shifting from hardware-based solutions to mobile-first, adaptive solutions. These reviews provide sound insights into integrating new technologies to enhance performance without compromising security and privacy levels.

Finally, fraud prevention and data security issues are central to geofenced attendance system adoption. Olajide (2024) explored fraud prevention with dynamic QR codes, geofencing, and IMEI verification, offering multi-layered protection against proxy attendance and device manipulation. Further research suggests encryption, role-based access, and secure backend designs to balance responsibility with employee privacy (Gupta, 2022; Afolab, 2021). As mobile applications handle sensitive geolocation and biometric information, these controls are necessary to ethical deployment.

Synthesis
Overall, the reviewed literature reflects a uniform trend towards mobile geofenced attendance verification as the better alternative to conventional systems. Researchers have underscored the advantage of biometric authentication, geolocation integration, and IoT-supported systems in curbing absenteeism, fraud prevention, and enhanced accountability. Implementations in education, corporate, and field service sectors substantiate the flexibility of these systems, while systematic reviews attest the research maturity of geofencing. Meanwhile, energy efficiency, user privacy, and fraud protection issues reflect the necessity for optimized, secure designs. In order to address these shortcomings, the presented FieldCheck: Mobile Geofenced Attendance Verification App for Field-Based Workers seeks to provide an end-to-end solution that integrates geofencing accuracy, task management, real-time synchronization, and secure mobile integration to benefit organizations with distributed and field-based workers.

CHAPTER 3: TECHNICAL BACKGROUND
================================================================================

3.1 Project Design

Research Design 
The study will adopt a Developmental Research Design (also known as Design and Development Research), which focuses on the systematic design, creation, testing, and evaluation of an innovative technology solution. This approach is appropriate since the study's main objective is to develop and validate a self-hosted, cost-effective, and secure attendance verification system.

Overview
FieldCheck is designed as a two-tier system:

Employee Mobile Application – a Flutter-based cross-platform app (Android/iOS) for GPS-verified attendance, task management, and offline data synchronization.

Admin Dashboard – a web interface for geofence management (circular and polygon), employee assignment, task assignment, real-time monitoring, and comprehensive reporting with PDF/Excel export capabilities.

Core Design Principles

Accuracy – Leverages GPS and optional Bluetooth beacons for precise location detection, with support for both circular and polygon-based geofences.

Privacy & Control – Entirely self-hosted; no reliance on paid third-party APIs or external clouds.

Reliability – Offline caching with automatic synchronization once connectivity is restored; robust error handling and data validation.

Cost Efficiency – Uses open-source mapping libraries (Flutter Map with OpenStreetMap) and a local/private backend (Node.js or Laravel).

Scalability – Modular architecture supporting multiple geofences, employees, and concurrent real-time updates.

Usability – Intuitive interfaces for both field employees and administrators with minimal training requirements.

System Architecture

Frontend: Flutter mobile app with role-based interfaces for both employees and administrators.

Backend: Node.js/Express REST API with local database (MongoDB or PostgreSQL).

Mapping: Flutter Map for geofence creation and visualization using OpenStreetMap tiles (replacing paid Google Maps APIs).

Data Storage: On-premise or private cloud server for attendance records and user management.

Security: Role-based access, encrypted data transmission (HTTPS/TLS), JWT authentication, and optional two-factor authentication.

Real-Time Communication: Socket.io for live updates on attendance, tasks, and reports.

3.2 System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

An Iterative/Agile Model guides development to allow continuous feedback and rapid integration of features:

Planning & Requirement Analysis – Consolidation of objectives, identification of user roles (Admin, Employee), and feature mapping.

How This System Works

The FieldCheck system works by combining a mobile application for employees and an admin dashboard for supervisors or HR personnel. Employees use the mobile app to check in and out of their assigned job sites, but the system only allows attendance to be recorded if the employee is physically within the boundaries of a geofenced location. This verification process is powered by the device's GPS and may be enhanced with optional Bluetooth beacons for areas with weak signals, such as indoor or underground job sites.

When an employee attempts to log their attendance, the system checks their location in real time against the geofence coordinates set by the administrator. The system supports both circular geofences (defined by center coordinates and radius) and polygon geofences (defined by multiple coordinate sets forming a boundary). If the employee is within the correct job site, the system records the check-in or check-out time and saves it on the mobile device. In cases where internet connectivity is unavailable, the data is stored locally and automatically synchronized with the backend server once the device goes online again. This ensures that no attendance record is lost, even in remote or offline environments.

On the administrative side, supervisors access the system through the web-based dashboard. From this interface, they can create, edit, and manage geofences (both circular and polygon) for different work sites using an interactive map powered by Flutter Map and OpenStreetMap. Administrators can also view attendance logs, filter data for specific employees or teams, generate comprehensive reports, and export records in PDF or Excel format for auditing and payroll purposes. If enabled, they may also monitor employees' live locations during their shifts, providing an additional layer of oversight.

All recorded data is processed and stored in a secure, self-hosted backend system. This setup ensures that the organization retains full ownership and control over sensitive attendance and location information, eliminating reliance on costly third-party services or external cloud providers. The result is a reliable, private, and cost-efficient solution that strengthens workforce accountability, reduces fraudulent check-ins, and provides organizations with accurate and verifiable attendance records.

Process Model

The process of the FieldCheck system begins with the administrator, who is responsible for setting up the work environment within the application. Through the admin dashboard, the administrator creates and manages geofenced job site boundaries using an interactive map interface. Administrators can define circular geofences by specifying a center point and radius, or polygon geofences by plotting multiple coordinate points. Once the geofences are defined, the system associates employees with their designated work sites to ensure that only authorized users can record attendance within those locations.

When an employee arrives at a job site, they open the mobile application and attempt to check in. The system then processes the employee's location data by comparing the device's GPS coordinates with the geofenced area defined by the administrator. For circular geofences, the system uses the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between the employee's position and the geofence center. For polygon geofences, the system uses point-in-polygon algorithms (such as ray casting) to determine if the employee is within the boundary. If the employee is physically inside the geofence, the system validates the request and records the check-in time. If the employee attempts to check in outside of the defined boundary, the system rejects the request and notifies the user that attendance cannot be logged.

During the workday, employees may also check out through the same process. Each attendance entry is stored locally on the mobile device in case internet connectivity is unavailable. Once a stable connection is restored, the stored records automatically synchronize with the backend server, ensuring that all attendance data is preserved and consolidated.

The backend system processes all synchronized attendance records and stores them in the organization's self-hosted or private cloud infrastructure. This approach ensures that data privacy and security are maintained without reliance on third-party services.

On the administrative side, supervisors and HR personnel access the attendance data through the dashboard. They can view, filter, and export attendance logs in PDF or Excel format for reporting, auditing, and workforce monitoring. If the optional live tracking feature is enabled, administrators can also view the real-time location of employees during their assigned shifts.

This cycle continues for each workday, providing an automated and secure process that guarantees attendance is recorded only within authorized locations, reduces the possibility of falsified check-ins, and ensures organizations have accurate and verifiable records of field-based workforce activity.

Operational Feasibility

The operational feasibility of FieldCheck evaluates the practicality and readiness of the system for real-world implementation and daily use by organizations managing field-based employees. The system is designed to integrate seamlessly into existing workflows without requiring major changes in how employees record attendance or how administrators oversee field operations. By leveraging built-in GPS and geofencing technologies available on modern smartphones, the system ensures that users can easily adopt it with minimal technical training.

For employees, the mobile application is simple and intuitive to operate. The process of checking in and out only requires them to open the app and confirm their presence within the assigned geofenced job site. The inclusion of offline support ensures continuous functionality even in remote areas with weak or no internet connectivity. Attendance data is stored locally and automatically synchronized to the central server once the device reconnects to the internet. This feature guarantees uninterrupted operations in field environments, making the system reliable and adaptable to various working conditions.

From the administrative side, the web-based dashboard offers a straightforward and efficient interface for managing job sites, employee records, and attendance logs. Administrators can easily create or modify geofenced areas (circular or polygon) through an interactive map, view attendance summaries, generate comprehensive reports, and export data in multiple formats (PDF, Excel) for performance monitoring and compliance. The system's self-hosted architecture ensures that organizations retain full control of their data, improving both privacy and operational security compared to third-party cloud-based solutions.

Hardware costs limited to one local server and mobile devices already used by employees.

Reduced infrastructure costs through self-hosted deployment.

Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

The FieldCheck System allows employees to check in and out of job sites through a mobile app that records their GPS location and time. The system verifies the employee's location against pre-defined geofenced areas (circular or polygon) stored in the Geofence Database to ensure they are within the assigned worksite. Once verified, the system saves the attendance record, including employee ID, time, location, and geofence type, in the Attendance Database. Administrators can access the Admin Dashboard to create or modify geofences, view attendance logs, generate reports, and export data in PDF or Excel format. If employees are offline, their attendance data is stored locally on the mobile device and synchronized with the database once an internet connection is restored. The system also allows optional real-time tracking to monitor employee movement during active work hours.

4.3 Key Features Implemented

4.3.1 Geofencing Algorithm

Circular Geofence Validation:
The system uses the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between the employee's GPS coordinates and the geofence center. If the distance is less than or equal to the geofence radius, the employee is considered inside the geofence.

Formula: d = 2R * arcsin(sqrt(sin²((lat2-lat1)/2) + cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * sin²((lon2-lon1)/2)))

Where:
- R = Earth's radius (6,371 km)
- lat1, lon1 = Geofence center coordinates
- lat2, lon2 = Employee's GPS coordinates

Polygon Geofence Validation (Future Enhancement):
The system uses the ray casting algorithm to determine if a point (employee's GPS coordinates) is inside a polygon (geofence boundary). This algorithm counts how many times a ray from the point intersects the polygon edges. If the count is odd, the point is inside; if even, the point is outside.

4.3.2 Offline Synchronization

When the device detects no internet connection:
1. Attendance data is stored locally using SharedPreferences
2. A pending sync counter is displayed to the user
3. When connectivity is restored, the app automatically syncs the data
4. Synced records are removed from local storage
5. User receives confirmation of successful sync

4.3.3 Real-Time Updates

Socket.io is used to broadcast real-time updates:
- New attendance records trigger 'newAttendanceRecord' event
- Task assignments trigger 'newTask' event
- Task completions trigger 'taskCompleted' event
- Report submissions trigger 'newReport' event
- Admin dashboard updates automatically without page reload

4.3.4 Report Export Functionality

PDF Export:
- Uses PDFKit library for PDF generation
- Includes attendance data with employee name, date, check-in/out times, and location
