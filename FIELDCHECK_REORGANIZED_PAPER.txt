CHAPTER 1: THE PROBLEM AND ITS BACKGROUND
================================================================================

1.1 Introduction

In today's world, many organizations operate with employees scattered across
different locations. Whether it's maintenance crews, delivery services, construction
teams, or field inspectors, managing attendance for these workers has always been
a challenge. Traditionally, companies relied on paper-based logs or simple check-in
systems that could easily be manipulated. An employee might claim to be at a job
site when they're actually somewhere else, or someone could check in on behalf of
another worker. These problems have plagued organizations for years, leading to
inaccurate records and wasted resources.

In recent years, digital solutions have started to emerge. However, many of these
systems come with significant drawbacks. They often depend on expensive third-party
services, require ongoing subscription fees, or store company data on external cloud
servers. This creates two major concerns: the cost of maintaining these systems and
the risk of sensitive employee location data being stored on servers outside the
organization's control.

FieldCheck was created to address these issues directly. It's a mobile application
that uses GPS technology and geofencing to ensure employees can only record their
attendance when they're physically present at authorized work locations. The system
doesn't rely on expensive external services. Instead, it can be hosted locally or on
a private server that the organization controls. This approach significantly reduces
costs while giving companies complete control over their data and privacy.

The system combines two main components: a mobile app for employees and a backend
server for data processing and storage. Together, they create a comprehensive solution
for tracking field-based workers accurately and securely.

1.2 Field Area of Project or Study

This project draws from several important areas of technology and business:

- GPS and Geofencing Systems – Using location data to control and verify access
- Workforce Attendance Monitoring – Tools and methods for tracking employee presence
- Location-Based Services – Software that uses geographic positioning for various purposes
- Self-Hosted Mobile Systems – Applications deployed on local infrastructure rather than public clouds
- Mobile Application Development – Building apps using the Flutter framework
- Real-Time Communication Systems – Technologies that enable instant data updates across systems

1.3 Problems of the Study

1.3.1 General Problem

Organizations with mobile or field-based workers face a significant challenge: how do
you verify that employees are actually where they say they are? Without proper
verification, it's easy for workers to falsify their location, leading to inaccurate
attendance records and wasted company resources.

1.3.2 Specific Problems

1. Fraudulent Attendance Records – Workers can easily claim to be at a job site when
   they're actually elsewhere, making it impossible to trust attendance data

2. Expensive Third-Party Services – Most modern attendance systems require subscriptions
   or API fees, which add up quickly for organizations with many employees

3. Data Privacy Concerns – When companies use cloud-based systems, their sensitive
   employee location data is stored on external servers, raising privacy and security
   questions

4. Poor Performance in Remote Areas – Many systems fail when internet connectivity is
   weak or unavailable, which is exactly when field workers need the system most

5. Disconnected Systems – Attendance tracking and task management often operate
   separately, creating confusion and inefficiency in daily operations

6. Difficult Reporting – Generating reports and exporting data is often a manual,
   time-consuming process that slows down decision-making

1.4 Objectives of the Study

1.4.1 General Objective

The main goal of this project is to create a mobile application that tracks employee
attendance accurately and in real-time using GPS and geofencing technology. The system
should work without relying on expensive third-party services, allowing organizations
to maintain complete control over their data while reducing operational costs.

1.4.2 Specific Objectives

1. Design a geofencing system using Flutter Map and GPS that prevents employees from
   checking in unless they're physically at an authorized job location

2. Create a task management feature that lets administrators assign specific tasks to
   employees and track whether those tasks are completed

3. Implement an offline mode that saves attendance data locally when there's no internet
   connection, then automatically uploads it when connectivity returns

4. Build a real-time admin interface within the mobile app that shows live updates of
   employee locations and attendance status without requiring page refreshes

5. Reduce costs by using free mapping tools (OpenStreetMap) instead of expensive
   commercial mapping APIs

6. Add the ability to export attendance and task data as PDF and Excel files for
   reporting and payroll purposes

7. Support both circular and polygon-shaped geofences to accommodate different types
   of job site boundaries

1.5 Scope and Limitations

1.5.1 Scope

The system consists of a single integrated mobile application:

FieldCheck Mobile App (Flutter): Available for Android and iOS with role-based interfaces:

Employee Interface: Features include secure login (JWT), GPS-based check-in/out, task
viewing, offline data caching, and PDF/Excel report generation.

Admin Interface: Allows creation of circular and polygon geofences, employee profile
management, task assignment, attendance reporting with export functionality, and
real-time monitoring—all accessible from the mobile app.

Backend Server: A Node.js and Express server handles all the business logic and data
processing.

The project focuses primarily on GPS-based geofencing. While Bluetooth beacons could
be added in the future for better accuracy in indoor environments, they're not part
of the initial release. The offline functionality is a key feature, allowing the app
to work even when internet connectivity is temporarily lost.

1.5.2 Limitations

Like any project, this system has some constraints:

- GPS Accuracy: The system's accuracy depends on the phone's hardware and environmental
  conditions. Tall buildings or dense forests can interfere with GPS signals

- Initial Login Required: While the app works offline, users need an internet connection
  to log in initially and download their assigned job sites

- Battery Usage: Constantly using GPS drains phone batteries faster than normal apps.
  Users should be aware of this when using the system during long shifts

- Bluetooth Beacons: Adding Bluetooth beacons for better accuracy would require
  additional hardware investment, so this isn't included in the first version

- Complex Calculations: Polygon geofences require more complex calculations, which
  might slow down older phones

1.6 Significance of the Study

This project benefits several groups:

Company Management: The system provides a reliable way to verify that employees are
actually at their assigned locations. This prevents fraud and makes payroll processing
easier through automated reporting and data export features.

Field Employees: Workers get a simple, straightforward way to record their work hours.
The offline functionality means they don't have to worry about losing data if they
temporarily lose internet connection. They also have a clear digital record of their
work hours and completed tasks.

The IT Field: This project demonstrates that organizations don't need to pay for
expensive mapping APIs. Open-source solutions like Flutter Map and OpenStreetMap can
provide the same functionality at no cost, making advanced location-based systems
accessible to smaller organizations.

By hosting the system locally, organizations maintain complete control over their data,
reduce ongoing costs, and can customize the system to fit their specific needs.

1.7 Definition of Terms

Geofencing: An imaginary boundary drawn around a physical location using GPS coordinates.
When a mobile device enters this boundary, the system can trigger specific actions, like
allowing an attendance check-in.

JWT (JSON Web Token): A secure way to verify that a user is who they claim to be. It's
like a digital ID card that proves a user is authenticated without storing passwords.

MongoDB: A database system that stores information in a flexible, document-based format,
similar to how information might be organized in JSON files.

Socket.io: A technology that allows real-time communication between a server and mobile
or web clients, enabling instant updates without requiring users to refresh their screens.

Offline Synchronization: The process of saving data locally on a device when internet
is unavailable, then automatically uploading that data to the central server once
connectivity returns.

Flutter: An open-source framework created by Google for building mobile apps that work
on both Android and iOS from a single codebase.

Flutter Map: An open-source package for Flutter that provides interactive mapping
capabilities using free OpenStreetMap data, eliminating the need for paid mapping APIs.

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): A security approach that determines what different
types of users can do in the system. For example, administrators might have access to
all features, while regular employees only see their own data.

Haversine Formula: A mathematical formula used to calculate the distance between two
points on Earth given their latitude and longitude coordinates. Used for circular
geofence validation.

Ray Casting Algorithm: A computational geometry technique used to determine if a point
lies inside a polygon. Used for polygon geofence validation.

CHAPTER 2: REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE
================================================================================

2.1 Overview

The way organizations track employee attendance has evolved significantly over the
past few decades. What started as simple paper logs has gradually transformed into
digital systems powered by mobile technology and location data. This evolution has
been driven by the limitations of older methods—they're easy to fake, expensive to
maintain, and don't work well in field environments.

2.2 GPS and Geofencing Technology in Workforce Management

Recent research shows that GPS and geofencing technology have become the standard
approach for modern attendance systems. Researchers like Kurnia and colleagues (2025)
developed mobile apps that verify workers are at specific locations before recording
attendance. Similarly, Shinde's team (2022) created systems that use geofencing to
improve accuracy in monitoring field workers. These solutions have proven effective
at preventing fraudulent check-ins and reducing the need for expensive hardware-based
biometric systems.

Harshada and colleagues (2023) specifically examined GPS-based attendance systems using
geofencing, demonstrating the technology's reliability in real-world conditions. Their
work confirmed that geofencing provides a practical and cost-effective solution for
organizations seeking to verify employee locations without expensive infrastructure.

2.3 Attendance Verification with Biometric Integration

Many researchers have gone further by combining geofencing with biometric technology.
For example, Aigbokhan and colleagues (2024) created a system that uses both GPS and
facial recognition to verify both location and identity. This two-layer approach is
more secure because it prevents someone from checking in on behalf of another worker.
Other researchers, like Pawar's team (2024), added real-time face detection to prevent
spoofing attacks where someone uses a photo instead of appearing in person.

Babatunde and colleagues (2022) developed a mobile-based student attendance system
combining geofencing with timing and face recognition, demonstrating the effectiveness
of multi-factor verification approaches. Fadillah and Jalil (2024) similarly designed
an attendance application using face recognition and location-based services on Android,
showing the versatility of combining multiple verification methods.

2.4 Comprehensive Workforce Management Systems

Beyond just attendance tracking, researchers have explored how geofencing can be part
of a larger workforce management system. GeoWorkTrack (Tile et al., 2024) and similar
systems extend geofencing to include employee tracking, task assignment, and productivity
monitoring. This shows that geofencing isn't just useful for attendance—it can be part
of a comprehensive management solution.

Tamboli and colleagues (2024) examined attendance management systems using geofencing
technology, while Fischer and colleagues (2024) designed a university smart attendance
tracking system using geo-location and IoT. These studies demonstrate that geofencing
can be applied across various organizational contexts.

2.5 Diverse Applications and Use Cases

The technology has been applied in many different settings. Universities use it to track
student attendance (Mohammed, 2021; Eweoya et al., 2025), companies use it for employee
monitoring, and some organizations even use it for child safety monitoring (Agajo et al.,
2023). This wide range of applications demonstrates how versatile geofencing technology
really is.

Kumavat and colleagues (2023) developed a student attendance tracking system, while
Barbaso and colleagues (2025) created AttendEase, an online-onsite router-based mobile
application for tracking faculty and student attendance. Venkatesh and colleagues (2024)
developed a geofenced intelligent attendance system featuring facial recognition.

2.6 Technical Challenges and Solutions

However, researchers have also identified challenges that need to be addressed. Battery
drain and connectivity issues can limit GPS-based systems (Harshada et al., 2023).
Rexline and Nazrin (2024) suggested using lighter-weight approaches to reduce power
consumption, while Fatkharrofiqi's team (2020) showed how to optimize location-based
services for Android to minimize system overhead.

Kumawat (2021) addressed the challenge of attendance management by combining fingerprint
and voice recognition with geofence technology. Thiagarajan and colleagues (2025)
developed a smart attendance management system using NRF51822 BLE module and mobile
application, showing alternative approaches to traditional GPS-based systems.

2.7 Security and Fraud Prevention

Security and fraud prevention are also major concerns in the literature. Olajide (2024)
explored multiple ways to prevent fraud, including dynamic QR codes, geofencing, and
device verification. Other researchers emphasize the importance of encryption, proper
access controls, and secure system design to protect employee privacy while preventing
fraud (Gupta, 2022; Afolab, 2021).

Kundariya and colleagues (2024) examined geofencing and location-based attendance
systems with emphasis on security. Khodaskar and colleagues (2023) developed a smart
attendance capturing mobile app with security considerations.

2.8 Industry Trends and Future Directions

When researchers reviewed the overall state of attendance technology, they identified
clear trends. Ali and colleagues (2022) found that geolocation, biometrics, and cloud
integration are the leading approaches. Abdalkarim and Sakarya (2022) confirmed that
the industry is moving away from hardware-based solutions toward mobile-first systems
that are more flexible and easier to use.

Seng Keau and colleagues (2021) developed Smart-Hadir, a mobile-based attendance
management system, demonstrating the industry's shift toward mobile solutions.

2.9 Synthesis and Justification

Based on the review of related literature, FieldCheck addresses a well-established need
in workforce management. The research community has clearly established that geofencing-
based attendance systems are the way forward. The evidence shows they're more secure than
traditional methods, they can be combined with other technologies like biometrics for
extra security, and they work across many different industries and settings.

FieldCheck specifically addresses the main challenges identified in the literature:

1. Managing battery usage through optimized GPS sampling and background task scheduling
2. Ensuring systems work in areas with poor connectivity through offline synchronization
3. Protecting employee privacy through self-hosted architecture and local data storage
4. Reducing costs by using open-source solutions instead of expensive commercial APIs
5. Providing comprehensive workforce management beyond just attendance tracking

The combination of proven geofencing technology with offline functionality, real-time
updates, task management, and a self-hosted architecture that gives organizations
complete control over their data makes FieldCheck a comprehensive solution that directly
addresses the gaps identified in existing research.

CHAPTER 3: TECHNICAL BACKGROUND
================================================================================

3.1 Project Design

3.1.1 Research Design

This project uses a Developmental Research Design combined with an Agile development
methodology. Developmental Research Design means we're not just studying something that
already exists—we're actually building and testing a new technology solution. This
approach makes sense because our main goal is to create a working system and then
evaluate how well it performs in real-world conditions.

The Agile methodology guides how we build the system. Rather than planning everything
upfront and building it all at once (Waterfall), we work in short cycles, building
features incrementally, testing them, and improving based on feedback. This allows us
to adapt quickly if we discover new requirements or challenges during development.

3.1.2 Overview

FieldCheck is built as a two-part system. The first part is a mobile app for employees,
built using Flutter so it works on both Android and iOS phones. The second part is a
backend server for data processing and storage.

The mobile app lets employees check in and out at job sites using GPS verification.
It also handles task management, stores data locally when there's no internet, and
can generate reports.

3.1.3 Core Design Principles

We built FieldCheck around several key ideas:

Accuracy – The system uses GPS to pinpoint employee locations. It can handle both
simple circular boundaries and complex polygon-shaped boundaries. In the future,
Bluetooth beacons could be added for even better accuracy indoors.

Privacy and Control – The system doesn't rely on any external services. Everything
is hosted locally or on a private server that the organization controls. This means
the company owns all its data.

Reliability – The system works even when the internet is down. Data is stored locally
and automatically syncs when connectivity returns. The system is designed to handle
errors gracefully.

Cost Efficiency – We use free, open-source mapping tools instead of expensive
commercial APIs. This dramatically reduces costs.

Scalability – The system is built in a modular way, so it can handle more employees,
more job sites, and more concurrent users as the organization grows.

Usability – Both employees and administrators should be able to use the system without
extensive training. The interfaces are designed to be intuitive and straightforward.

3.6 System Architecture

3.6.1 Architecture Overview

[FIGURE 3.2: SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM]
(Insert diagram showing: Mobile App ↔ Backend Server ↔ Database)

The system has several layers:

Frontend: Flutter mobile app with role-based interfaces for both employees and
administrators.

Backend: A Node.js and Express server handles all the business logic and data processing.

Mapping: We use Flutter Map with OpenStreetMap data for creating and displaying
geofences. This replaces the need for expensive commercial mapping APIs.

Data Storage: All data is stored on a local or private server, not on external clouds.

Security: The system uses role-based access control, encrypted data transmission,
JWT tokens for authentication, and optional two-factor authentication.

Real-Time Updates: Socket.io enables instant updates across the system without
requiring users to refresh their screens.

3.6.2 Component Descriptions

Mobile Application Layer:
- Employee Interface: Check-in/out, task management, reports
- Admin Interface: Geofence management, employee management, task assignment, reports
- Local Storage: Offline data caching using SQLite
- GPS Module: Location tracking and geofence validation

Backend API Layer:
- Authentication Service: JWT token management and user verification
- Geofence Service: Geofence creation, validation, and management
- Attendance Service: Attendance record processing and storage
- Task Service: Task management and assignment
- Report Service: Report generation and export
- Real-Time Service: Socket.io event broadcasting

Data Layer:
- Users Collection: User profiles and credentials
- Geofences Collection: Geofence definitions and boundaries
- Attendance Collection: Attendance records
- Tasks Collection: Task definitions and assignments
- Reports Collection: Generated reports

3.7 Operational Feasibility

The FieldCheck application is capable of ensuring the user provides clear features and
operates the system efficiently. It directly supports organizations by facilitating
instant employee location verification through geofencing, alongside providing effortless
task management and real-time monitoring on a user-friendly mobile application.

Key feasibility factors:

User Acceptance: The system has simple, intuitive interfaces that require minimal
training. Highly Feasible.

Ease of Use: Checking in and out is straightforward. The offline functionality handles
connectivity issues automatically. Feasible.

Reliability: The system is designed to work in real field conditions with offline
support and automatic syncing. Highly Feasible.

Integration with Workflow: The system replaces manual attendance logs without changing
how the organization operates. Feasible.

Training Requirements: Minimal training is needed. The app has visual instructions and
helpful tooltips. Feasible.

Maintenance and Support: The system is self-hosted, so the organization's IT team can
maintain it. The code is modular and easy to update. Feasible.

Data Privacy and Security: The self-hosted architecture means the organization owns
all its data. Data is encrypted during transmission. Highly Feasible.

Operational Cost: There are no third-party API fees. The system runs on existing
infrastructure. Highly Feasible.

System Scalability: The backend can handle multiple concurrent users and job sites.
Feasible.

Report Export: PDF and Excel export functionality is built in. Highly Feasible.

3.8 Technical Feasibility

The technologies we chose are well-established and widely used:

- Flutter is open-source and has an active community
- Node.js and Express are industry standards for backend development
- Flutter Map is a mature package with good documentation
- Offline synchronization using local storage is a proven approach
- Polygon geofencing algorithms are well-understood and efficient
- PDF and Excel export libraries are readily available

All technologies have extensive documentation, active communities, and proven track
records in production systems. The development team has experience with all chosen
technologies, making the project technically feasible.

3.9 Economic Feasibility

The system is cost-effective because:

- We use free mapping tools instead of paying for Google Maps APIs (saves $10,000+/year)
- The system runs on a single local server instead of expensive cloud infrastructure
- There are no recurring subscription fees
- The organization already owns the mobile devices employees use
- Open-source technologies eliminate licensing costs
- Self-hosted architecture gives complete cost control

Total cost of ownership is significantly lower than commercial alternatives.

3.18 Algorithms

3.18.1 Haversine Formula (Circular Geofence Validation)

The Haversine formula calculates the great-circle distance between two points on Earth
given their latitude and longitude:

d = 2R × arcsin(√(sin²((lat2-lat1)/2) + cos(lat1) × cos(lat2) × sin²((lon2-lon1)/2)))

Where:
- d = distance between points
- R = Earth's radius (6,371 km)
- lat1, lon1 = employee's coordinates
- lat2, lon2 = geofence center coordinates

If d ≤ geofence radius, the employee is within the geofence and can check in.

3.18.2 Ray Casting Algorithm (Polygon Geofence Validation)

The ray casting algorithm determines if a point lies inside a polygon by:

1. Draw a ray from the point to infinity
2. Count how many times the ray crosses polygon edges
3. If count is odd, point is inside; if even, point is outside

This algorithm is used for complex polygon-shaped geofences that don't fit the circular
model.

3.19 Security Implementation

3.19.1 Authentication

The system uses JWT tokens for authentication. When a user logs in, the server creates
a token that proves the user's identity. This token is sent with every request to the
server.

Access tokens expire after 1 hour, requiring users to refresh their session. Refresh
tokens expire after 7 days, requiring a new login.

3.19.2 Authorization

The system implements role-based access control. Administrators can access all features,
while employees can only see their own data and assigned tasks.

3.19.3 Data Encryption

All data transmitted between the mobile app and server is encrypted using HTTPS/TLS.
Passwords are hashed using bcryptjs before storage in the database.

3.20 Offline Synchronization

When the employee opens the app and attempts to check in, the app reads their GPS
location. If the device is offline, the check-in is saved locally on the phone. When
connectivity returns, the app automatically syncs all saved data with the backend server.

The sync process:
1. Detects the restored connection
2. Retrieves all stored records from local storage
3. Sends them to the backend server
4. Waits for confirmation from the server
5. Deletes the records from local storage once confirmed

This ensures no data is lost and the system stays in sync.

3.21 Real-Time Updates

Socket.io maintains a persistent connection between the app and the server. When
something changes (like a new attendance record or task assignment), the server
broadcasts an update to all connected administrators. This means administrators see
updates instantly without refreshing their screen.
