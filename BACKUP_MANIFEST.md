## 🔄 Backup Management

### Create Another Backup
```powershell
# Any time you want a new backup:
Compress-Archive -Path "FIELDCHECK_2.0" -DestinationPath "FIELDCHECK_2.0_BACKUP_$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd_HHmmss').zip"

# This creates: FIELDCHECK_2.0_BACKUP_[DATE]_[TIME].zip
```

### Automatic Daily Backups (Advanced)
Create a Windows scheduled task to backup daily:
- But for now, manual backup is fine!

### Cloud Backup (Optional)
- Google Drive: Upload zip file
- OneDrive: Sync folder
- AWS S3: Cloud storage
- But GitHub already has your code!

---

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

### MongoDB Password Safety ⚠️
- The backup includes `.env` with MongoDB password
- ✅ Keep this backup in a safe location
- ✅ Don't share with untrusted people
- ✅ Only share if you trust them with database access

### What to Do If You Lose It
1. You still have GitHub (full code backup)
2. You still have MongoDB Atlas (all data in cloud)
3. You can rebuild from GitHub in 15 minutes
4. But having local backup is faster!

### Restore Process
If you need to restore:
1. Extract zip file
2. Run `npm install` in backend (2 min)
3. Run `flutter pub get` in frontend (2 min)
4. Run `npm start` and `flutter run`
5. **All working!** ✅

## 📈 Backup Best Practices

### Create Regular Backups
- ✅ After major changes
- ✅ Before deploying to production
- ✅ Before giving to groupmates
- ✅ Weekly during development

### Store Safely
- ✅ External hard drive at home
- ✅ External hard drive at school
- ✅ Cloud storage (with password protection)
- ✅ Never just one copy!

### Name Your Backups
```
Good Names:
• FIELDCHECK_2.0_BACKUP_20251113_194715.zip (includes date/time)
• FIELDCHECK_2.0_BEFORE_GROUPMATE_TESTING.zip
• FIELDCHECK_2.0_PRODUCTION_READY.zip

Bad Names:
• backup.zip (which backup?)
• old.zip (when?)
```
