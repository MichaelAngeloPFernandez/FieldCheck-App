SUMMARY OF FORMAT ISSUES
================================================================================

CRITICAL ISSUES (Should Fix):
1. ❌ Chapter 2: Missing topic subsections
   Impact: Makes literature review harder to navigate
   Fix: Reorganize by topic with clear subsection headers

2. ❌ Chapter 2: Missing Synthesis and Justification section
   Impact: Doesn't summarize how literature supports the project
   Fix: Add explicit synthesis section at end of Chapter 2

3. ❌ Chapter 3: Missing hardware/software requirements tables
   Impact: Less professional and specific than reference
   Fix: Add detailed requirements tables

4. ❌ Chapter 3: Missing System Flowchart, IPO Model, Use Case Diagram
   Impact: Incomplete requirements modeling
   Fix: Add these diagrams if available

MODERATE ISSUES (Consider Fixing):
5. ⚠️ Chapter 1: Scope and Limitations are separate
   Impact: Different from reference format
   Fix: Consider combining into single section

6. ⚠️ Chapter 3: Missing schedule feasibility with Gantt chart
   Impact: No visual timeline shown
   Fix: Add Gantt chart if available

7. ⚠️ Chapter 3: Missing User Interface section with screenshots
   Impact: No visual design shown
   Fix: Add UI screenshots/mockups

8. ⚠️ Chapter 3: Environment section lacks specific locale/population
   Impact: Less specific than reference
   Fix: Add specific location and population details

MINOR ISSUES (Optional):
9. ✓ Additional sections (Field Area, Problems) are GOOD additions
   Impact: Strengthens the paper
   Recommendation: KEEP these sections

================================================================================
RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
================================================================================

PRIORITY 1 (Must Do):
1. Reorganize Chapter 2 with topic subsections
2. Add Synthesis and Justification section to Chapter 2
3. Add hardware/software requirements tables to Chapter 3

PRIORITY 2 (Should Do):
4. Add System Flowchart to Chapter 3
5. Add IPO Model to Chapter 3
6. Add Use Case Diagram to Chapter 3
7. Add UI screenshots to Chapter 3

PRIORITY 3 (Nice to Have):
8. Combine Scope and Limitations in Chapter 1
9. Add Gantt chart to Chapter 3
10. Expand Environment section with specific locale/population

================================================================================
ESTIMATED EFFORT
================================================================================

Priority 1 Tasks: 2-3 hours
- Reorganizing Chapter 2: 1 hour
- Adding Synthesis section: 30 minutes
- Creating requirements tables: 1 hour

Priority 2 Tasks: 2-3 hours
- Creating diagrams (if not already done): 2-3 hours

Priority 3 Tasks: 1-2 hours
- Combining sections and adding details: 1-2 hours

Total Estimated Time: 5-8 hours

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

Our paper is WELL-STRUCTURED and COMPREHENSIVE. However, to match the reference
paper's format more closely and improve professionalism, we should:

1. ✓ KEEP our additional sections (Field Area, Problems) - they strengthen the paper
2. ✓ REORGANIZE Chapter 2 with topic subsections
3. ✓ ADD Synthesis and Justification section
4. ✓ ADD requirements tables and diagrams to Chapter 3
5. ✓ ADD UI screenshots to Chapter 3

These changes will make our paper MORE PROFESSIONAL and EASIER TO READ while
maintaining all the unique and specific content we've already created.
